### clone/download and manually install:

you will have to download this folder and add it under `~/.vscode/extensions/` on Mac or `C:\Users\[username]\.vscode\extensions` on Windows!

i dont write code in every language or use every feature of VS Code, so i'm sure there are some unthemed oversights. if you find some, let me know!
